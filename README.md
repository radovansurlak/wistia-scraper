Simple Wistia video scraper which grabs links from `./link.txt` file and downloads videos to `./downloads` folder

The links should look like this:
`<p><a href="https://wistia.com/support/embed-and-share/video-on-your-website?wvideo=lbo2kwzc81"><img src="https://embed-fastly.wistia.com/deliveries/90e8c9f55b2d19d0e91e201422ae0e12.jpg?image_play_button_size=2x&amp;image_crop_resized=960x540&amp;image_play_button=1&amp;image_play_button_color=4267b2e0" width="400" height="225" style="width: 400px; height: 225px;"></a></p><p><a href="https://wistia.com/support/embed-and-share/video-on-your-website?wvideo=lbo2kwzc81">Embedding Video on Your Website — Support — Wistia</a></p>`

Links should be separated by new line.

You can get this link by right-clicking a Wistia video and selecting **Copy link and thumbnail**
